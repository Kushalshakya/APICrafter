## Installation

1. Download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app [app_name]`.

If Composer is installed globally, run

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

## Configuration

Read and edit the environment specific `config/app_local.php` and set up the
`'Datasources'` and any other configuration relevant for your application.
Other environment agnostic settings can be changed in `config/app.php`.
